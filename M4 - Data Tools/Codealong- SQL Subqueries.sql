-- Problem: What types of documentaries are performing best?
-- Outcomes: Identify which general theme should you commission for to be in English? 
-- Actions: We need to identify English spoken documentaries and aggregate their review scores.
-- Data: A dataset containing Netflix’s shows and review scores 
-- Questions to query: 
--   What are the documentaries that are in English?
--   What are the highest rated English documentaries? 
--   What are the general themes of the highest rated English documentaries?

-- To perform the queries: 
--   We need to look at the Genre and three review scores columns and combine them into a subquery
--   From there we can look at the different specific genres. 

-- Note: a useful function to research is SPLIT_PART()
