    "A lot of APIs, if they are popular enough, will already have a Python package available that will help you interact with them. Under the hood they are really just doing exactly the same thing we've been doing with Requests, but usually bundled up nicely to make it easier to work with an API. For example,  the [Dog API](https://pypi.org/project/pydogceo/) and [Agify](https://pypi.org/project/agify/) services we used earlier both have Python packages!\n",

    "It's worth looking for a package that interacts with the API you are interested in using, as they often take a lot of the headaches out of things like authentication, and retrieving data in a useable format. But it's still useful to be able to use Requests, to understand what these packages are doing under the hood, and to make custom API requests for yourself if you need more than a package provides."
