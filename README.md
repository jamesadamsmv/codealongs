# Codealongs and Solutions

Each folder represents one module. Within each folder, 'Codealong' files contain comments as an outline to follow along with during each workshop. Then, 'Solution' files contain examples of the completed code for each codealong.

**Note:** When copying and pasting these into another editor, such as bit.io, always click the **'Raw'** button to get the plain text version of the code to copy and paste - this avoids any extra bits of formatting getting into your code and messing things up!
